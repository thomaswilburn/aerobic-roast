      <h1>You've left a lot of fingerprints on this newsroom (hint, hint).</h1>
      
      <p>
        I don't think I could have had a better partner in crime for my first year at the Times. We did good work together, and you helped me get <strike>News Apps</strike> Interactives situated in the newsroom. That's something to be proud of.
        
      <p>
        So I'm sorry you won't be getting your hands dirty with us anymore. It's been a lot of fun working with you. But I'm sure you're going to knock 'em dead at Yale, and I can't wait to see where you'll go from there.
